**No Speaky - By FAXES**

**About**
So. What does this one do FAXES? Well kids, this lets you use /mute (or whatever changed too) to mute people in voice chat. Someone screaming, ear-raping you? Well **MUTE THEM** with this script. *Please note; if using Lambda this script will not work as lambda overwrites users settings.*
